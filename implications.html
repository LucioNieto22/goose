  In 2015 statcast was intorduced to baseball, which is a state of the 
  art tracking technology that analysizes incredible amounts of data that
  was never able to be done before. One of the things that it tracks is 
  Revolutions Per Minute (RPM). Teams quickly used the analytics to thier advantage, 
  one thing teams found was that the Higher RPM a pitcher put on a ball, on sverage
  there is a higher success rate. Teams found that with the use of foreign substance such as 
  spider tack they could dramticlly increase thier RPM instantly. This became widley used 
  and although it was illegal, the league did nothing about it for many years until midway through 
  the 2021 season when they began foreign substance.
