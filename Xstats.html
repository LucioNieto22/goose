<h1> What are X-Stats </h1>
<div class="border p-4 bg-dark">
  <p>
    <a style = "color: violet;">
  Stats such as Expected Batting Average (xBA)
    are considered to be more indicative of a player’s true skill level than their more traditionally used counterparts such as, 
    ERA (Earned Run Average ), and BA (Batting Average ). 

  Most statisticians believe that while a hitter or pitcher has the ability to influence the exit velocity and launch angle of a batted ball, 
  the player has little to no control over what happens to the ball once it’s put in play.
   Thus, “expected” stats are used to determine how successful a player is when defense is removed from the equation.
  By eliminating the defensive variables from the equation, X stats are caulculated
  using Launch Angle, Exit Velocity, and Sprint Speed, these lets us calculate an "Expected"
  outcome from all batted balls. Expected stats reflect a fundamental truth of baseball,
   which is that a player’s numbers in a given stretch are not always representative of how well he is hitting or throwing the ball.
Therefor as fans we can see which players have been getting "lucky" and which players
will likley progress to thier mean by seeing weather thier xBA is higher or lower than their actual BA.

<p> The model above shows the corralation between the 
  exit velocity and the launch angle. Here we can see that 
  the higher exit velocity the more likely a batted ball
  is to result in a hit. In addition we can see that around
  20 degrees of launch angle his the best batted ball outcome.
